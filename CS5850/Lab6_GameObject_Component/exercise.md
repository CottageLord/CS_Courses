- Exercise 1 -- list some of the components that you think are associated with some of the game objects you see in the following screenshot. You should be able to identify at least 3 individual 'components' that make up the game objects shown.
  - Remember that components are things that could be added to GameObjects, such that they can change or add behavior to that particular game object.
    -  For reference, you may look at other Game Engines like Unity3D for inspiration: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html


1. Collision - process interactions between collideable objects
2. Rigidbody - process forces, gravity, etc.
3. Render    - process drawing
